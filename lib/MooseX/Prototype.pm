=head1 NAME

MooseX::Prototype - prototype-based programming for Moose

=head1 SYNOPSIS

From Wikipedia: I<< "Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented
programming in which classes are not present, and behaviour reuse (known as
inheritance in class-based languages) is performed via a process of cloning
existing objects that serve as prototypes." >>

   use MooseX::Prototype;
   
   my $Person = object {
      name       => undef,
   };
   
   my $Employee = $Person->new->extend({
      job        => undef,
      employer   => undef,
   });
   
   my $CivilServant = $Employee->new(
      employer   => 'Government',
   );
   
   $CivilServant->extend({
      department => undef,
   });
   
   my $bob = $CivilServant->new(
      name       => 'Robert',
      department => 'HMRC',
      job        => 'Tax Inspector',
   );
   
   print $bob->dump;
   
   # $VAR1 = bless( {
   #    name       => 'Robert',
   #    job        => 'Tax Inspector',
   #    department => 'HMRC',
   #    employer   => 'Government'
   # }, 'MooseX::Prototype::__ANON__::0006' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Due to familiarity with class-based languages such as Java, many
programmers assume that object-oriented programming is synonymous with
class-based programming. However, class-based programming is just one
kind of object-oriented programming style, and other varieties exist
such as role-oriented, aspect-oriented and prototype-based programming.

A prominent example of a prototype-based programming language is
ECMAScript (a.k.a. Javascript/JScript/ActionScript). ECMAScript does
provide a thin class-like layer over the top of its prototype-based
OO system, which some (even experienced) ECMAScript developers rarely
see beyond.

This module implements a thin prototype-like layer on top of L<Moose>'s
class/role-based toolkit.

=head2 Ex-Nihilo Object Creation

In prototype-based languages, objects are created by cloning other
objects. But it's often useful to be able to magic up an object out of
nowhere. MooseX::Prototype provides a convenience function to do this:

=over

=item C<< object \%attrs >>

Creates a new object with the given attributes. The hash is treated
as attribute-name, attribute-value pairs, but any names beginning with
C<< "&" >> are installed as methods. For example:

   my $person = object {
      "name"         => "Robert",
      "&changeName"  => sub {
         my ($self, $newname) = @_;
         $self->name($newname);
      },
   };

Objects created this way inherit from L<Moose::Object> and perform the
C<MooseX::Prototype::Trait::Object> role.

=back

=head2 Creating Objects from a Prototype

A prototype is just an object. When you create a new object from it,
the prototype will be cloned and the new object will inherit all its
attributes and methods.

=over

=item C<< $prototype->new(%attrs) >>

Creates a new object which inherits its methods and attributes from
C<< $prototype >>. The C<< %attrs >> hash can override attribute values
from the prototype, but cannot add new attributes or methods.

This method is provided by the C<MooseX::Prototype::Trait::Object>
role, so C<< $prototype >> must perform that role.

=item C<< $prototype->create_class >>

Rather than creating a new object from a prototype, this creates a whole
new Moose class which can be used to instantiate objects. If you need to
create a whole bunch of objects from a prototype, it is probably more
efficient to create a class and use that, rather than just calling C<new>
a bunch of times.

The class can be given a name, a la:

   $prototype->create_class("Foo::Bar");

Otherwise an arbitary name will be generated and returned.

This method is provided by the C<MooseX::Prototype::Trait::Object>
role, so C<< $prototype >> must perform that role.

=item C<< create_class_from_prototype($prototype) >>

A convenience function allowing you to use arbitary Moose objects (which
lack the C<create_class> method) as prototypes.

Also note:

   my $obj = create_class_from_prototype($proto)->new(%attrs);

This function is not exported by default, but can be exported using:

   use MooseX::Prototype -all;

=back

=head2 Extending Existing Objects

A key feature of Javascript is that new attributes and methods can be given
to an object using simple assignment;

   my_object.some_attribute = 123;
   my_object.some_method = function () { return 456 };

In MooseX::Prototype, there is an explicit syntax for adding new attributes
and methods to an object.

=over

=item C<< $object->extend(\%attrs) >>

As per ex-nihilo object creation, the attribute hashref can define attribute
name-value pairs, or new methods with a leading C<< "&" >>.

=back

=head1 HISTORY

Version 0.001 of MooseX::Prototype consisted of just a single function,
C<use_as_prototype> which was much the same as C<create_class_from_prototype>.

Version 0.002 is an almost complete rewrite.
